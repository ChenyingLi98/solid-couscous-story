The cat put its paw on the keyboard and had typed in a "}" in the correct position to solve Anna struggle to compile this program. Anna wondered if the cat had known how to code, so she decided to leave the cat with her computer 
for a while. She took a hour long break, and she decided to check in on her computer. She had found a whole inner class written for her project! She couldn't believe it! She decided to let her cat do the assignments for next week 
also. However, Anna soon will realize that this isn't a good idea.
